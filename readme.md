#hirst-painting

Save hundreds of thousands of dollars by creating your own Hirst-inspired painting.

This program will create a Hirst-inspired painting with colors of your selection. 

The Colorgram module is used to collect a list of RGB color codes. Colors from this list are (pseudo)randomly selected for each color in the painting.
